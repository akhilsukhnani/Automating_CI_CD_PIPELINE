ssh-keygen
#generating  keys
ssh-copy-id $USER@$DEST_IP
#copying the key in the system which is running the file or whose ip is mentioned at the execution of docker command for the passwordless and secure connection
/usr/bin/ssh
#to start ssh because we haven't installed package that can run systemctl command
java -jar /usr/lib/jenkins/jenkins.war
#this cmd is to start jenkins service
#all of these commands are written inside one file because CMD can only be used one time and in that one time we will run this complete file which in return will run the complete commands


Because we have to make some permission changes in ssh so that our jenkins container wont't find any error wile doing ssh connectivity with our base os
